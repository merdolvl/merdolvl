  Hey! I'm <strong>Merdan</strong>, an 18-year-old aspiring game engine developer from Germany. ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

## ðŸ›  About Me
- Currently developing **Chainsaw Engine**, a game engine written in **C++** using **CMake**.
- Passionate about **video game programming** and **science**.
- Interested in **graphics, AI, and general programming concepts**.
- Learning-focused approach with AI: I use it as a tool to enhance my understanding, not to copy work.
- Often rely on **OpenGL, CMake documentation, and programming cheat sheets** for reference.

## âš¡ Current Status
- The engine is under active development.
- I can't work on it every day due to school, but I aim to release a stable version soon.
- Once released, you will be able to **create your own games without a pre-existing game engine**.

## ðŸ“š Interests
- Game engine development
- Real-time graphics and rendering
- AI-assisted programming for learning
- General programming tips, tricks, and optimizations
